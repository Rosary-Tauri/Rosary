WELLS.</span><p><span class=smcap>Few</span> subjects have occasioned
greater controversy than that of baptism, and few have been
discussed with greater eagerness.  The baptismal service of
the Church of England has been a stumbling-block to many without
her pale, and been made the basis of the extreme views
entertained by many of those within.  Some have thought it
unscriptural, and have resolved in consequence upon separation
from our Church; while others have regarded it as containing the
Church’s principles more distinctly than the Articles, and
have founded upon it the doctrine of spiritual regeneration as
invariably connected with the sacrament.  The object of the
present tract is to compare the Prayer Book with the Bible: in
doing which it will be needless to attempt any statement of the
various opinions expressed upon the subject; our <a id=page4></a><span class=pagenum>p. 4</span>simpler and
safer course will be to turn at once to the books themselves.<h3>THE BIBLE</h3><p>of course must claim precedence, and our endeavour will be to
ascertain<p>I.  What is the inward and spiritual blessing connected
with the sacrament of baptism in Scripture?<p>II.  What is the nature of the connexion?<p>I.  That there are certain high and rich gifts connected
with baptism in sacred Scripture must be acknowledged by all who
study it in a childlike spirit.  Men may entertain different
opinions as to the connexion, and even as to the nature of the
gifts, but that there are such gifts it is surely impossible to
deny.  Few words may suffice to shew that the sum and
substance of these gifts is a saving union with our Lord Jesus
Christ.  In 1 Cor. xii. 13, it is written, “For by one
Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or
Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to
drink into one Spirit.”  That these words apply to the
inward and spiritual grace of which baptism is a sign and means,
lies on their very surface.  They are plainly speaking of an
inward and spiritual work, for they ascribe it to the agency of
the Holy Ghost himself—“By one Spirit are ye all
baptized;” while the use of <a id=page5></a><span class=pagenum>p. 5</span>the word “baptized” is
proof of a connexion between this inward change and the outward
sacrament.  The inward grace is the subject of the passage,
and this grace is connected by the language with the outward
sign.  We are, therefore, fully warranted in employing this
text as a description of that blessing with which baptism is
connected.  It does not teach us the nature of the
connection, but it does teach us the nature of the gift. 
And what is this blessing?  The formation of a union with
Christ Jesus; an engrafting into the living vine; an
incorporation amongst the members of His body.  The agent
who forms this union is the Holy Ghost.  “By one
Spirit.”  And the body with which the union is
established is the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ; the
body of which the Apostle speaks when he says, “And gave
Him to be the Head over all things to the Church, which is His
body.” (Eph. i. 22, 23.)<p>It is of the utmost importance that all should bear in mind
that this is the great, grand gift to be sought in baptism. 
The Bible says not a word of the implanting of a principle which
may or may not grow in after life; it speaks of nothing short of
a union with our Lord in its highest, holiest, and most
efficacious sense.  If the grace be really given, in the
fullest sense in which the words can be used we are made members
of the body of our Lord.  The same appears from many other
passages.  <a id=page6></a><span class=pagenum>p.
6</span>In Gal. iii. 26, 27, we read, “For ye are all the
children of God by faith in Jesus Christ.  For as many of
you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
Christ.”  And again, Rom. vi 3, 4, “Know ye not,
that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were
baptized into His death?  Therefore we are buried with Him
by baptism into death.”  These words are sometimes
thought to apply simply to the profession made.  As we are
not now inquiring into the nature of the connexion, we need not
pause to discuss that question: our only object at present is to
shew that a union with Christ is the inward blessing with which
baptism is connected in Scripture.  And this appears plainly
in both passages, for the words are, “Ye have put on
Christ.”  “Ye are baptized into Jesus
Christ.”<p>If this be plain, the remainder of our present inquiry will be
easy: for there are two changes immediately produced when this
union with Christ is formed, viz., a change of condition and a
change of heart.<h3>CHANGE OF CONDITION.</h3><p>No sooner is a union with Christ established, than there is a
complete change in our position before God.  When a man is
not in Christ, he stands alone, and bears the whole weight of
sin, both original and actual.  He is like the manslayer <a id=page7></a><span class=pagenum>p. 7</span>outside the
city of refuge, or like those who saw the waters of the flood
arising, but were themselves outside the ark.  Those that
are “without Christ” are “without hope,”
for it is written, (Eph. ii. 12,) “That at that time ye
were without Christ” (separate from Christ, not in union
with Him), “being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel,
and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and
without God in the world.  But now in Christ Jesus, ye who
sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of
Christ.”  Nothing can be plainer than the contrast
here drawn between men without Christ and men in Christ. 
Those without Him are strangers from the covenant; but those in
Him are reconciled, or made nigh by His blood.  In Christ
they are justified from all things.  They are no longer
under the curse, because His atonement has removed it from their
head.  “In Him we have redemption through His blood,
the forgiveness of sins.” (Coloss. i. 14.)  They are
no more regarded as sinners, for as their sin has been laid on
Christ, so His righteousness is imputed unto them. 
“He hath made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we
might be made the righteousness of God in Him.”<h3>CHANGE OF HEART.</h3><p>But there will also be a change of heart.  It is wholly
impossible that there should be a union so <a id=page8></a><span class=pagenum>p. 8</span>close, so
intimate, so rich in gifts as this is, without the likeness of
our Lord being formed in the heart of Him that is so united to
him.  The member of Christ must be like Him.  This
seems so obvious as scarcely to require proof.  If we be so
made one with Christ as to be accepted in Him, to share the love
shewn Him, to be regarded in all respects as members of His body,
we must be moulded after His likeness, and changed by the Holy
Ghost after His image.  The words of St. Paul, “He
that is joined to the Lord is one spirit,” set this
question at rest at once.  They shew that there must be a
change of heart whenever there is a union with the Lord. 
The same appears from 2 Cor. v, 17, 18, “Therefore if any
man be in Christ, he is a new creature, &amp;c.”  The
change here spoken of is not one of condition, or of covenant
relationship with God; but a new creation of the soul, a
renovation of the habit of the mind, of the thoughts, of the
affections, of the whole bearing of the new created spirit. 
“Old things are passed away, behold all things are become
new.”<p>None, therefore, can claim a union with Christ in whom no such
change has taken place.  The careless, thoughtless,
prayerless professor may be in outward fellowship with the
Church; but he is not, he cannot be, partaker of a union with
Jesus.  No system of man can dethrone from their sovereign
authority those awakening words of sacred <a id=page9></a><span class=pagenum>p. 9</span>Scripture,
“If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of
His.”<p>A union with Christ, therefore, involves invariably a change
of condition and a change of nature; it only remains that we
examine whether these change are connected in the word of God
with baptism.  If our first conclusion were correct, that a
union with Christ is the blessing connected with the sacrament,
it ought to follow that these two gifts are connected with it
likewise.<p>What then saith the Scripture respecting the change of
condition, or the pardon of our sins?  In Acts ii. 38, we
read, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name
of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive
the gift of the Holy Ghost.”  And in Acts xxii 16,
“Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on
the name of the Lord.”  Can anything be clearer than
that there is a connexion in these passages between baptism and
forgiveness?<p>A similar connexion may be observed between baptism and a
change of heart.<p>In John iii 5, believers are said to be “born of water
and of the Spirit.”  In the passage above referred to,
Acts ii. 38, the gift of the Holy Ghost is described as a gift
consequent on baptism.  “Ye shall receive the gift of
the Holy Ghost.”  In Eph. v. 26, there is a clear
connexion between baptism and the cleansing power of the
word.  “That He <a id=page10></a><span class=pagenum>p. 10</span>might sanctify it with the washing of
water by the word.” (See also Rom. vi.)<p>The whole of Scripture, therefore, is harmonious.  The
great, grand, primary gift is a union with Jesus; and as this is
inseparably connected with forgiveness of sin and renewal of
heart, so these two blessings are connected with the sacrament of
baptism.  This is the sense in which throughout the
following pages we employ the term
“regeneration.”<p>It is important that this definition should be borne in mind,
for, if we are not agreed as to the meaning of terms, there can
be no hope of agreement in our conclusions.  When,
therefore, the word regeneration is used in this tract it is in
the higher sense just described.  It is not used for that
admission into the visible church with all its privileges and
responsibilities which invariably takes place at baptism; nor is
it spoken of as the sowing of a certain seed, which may or may
not grow in after life; but it is employed to express the
commencement of a new life in the Lord Jesus Christ invariably
accompanied by justification and change of heart.  I am
anxious that there should be no mistake on this point; for those
who do not believe in the invariability of baptismal grace are
sometimes said to take low views of the sacrament of
baptism.  But nothing can be further from the fact, for it
is just because we take high views of <a id=page11></a><span class=pagenum>p. 11</span>the spiritual grace connected with it
that we believe that spiritual grace to be incompatible with the
ungodly lives of too many of the baptized.<p>We have thus far spoken of these spiritual blessings without
attempting to define their connexion with the outward sign. 
Our only concern, hitherto, has been to shew that there is such a
connexion clearly pointed out in the word of God.  It now
behoves us to examine—<p>II.  Into the nature of that connexion.<p>1.  And first we may remark, that the connexion is of
such a character as to lead the Apostles when addressing their
converts to assume the spiritual gift to have been received
wherever the outward sacrament had been administered.  The
language of St. Paul to the Corinthians may illustrate what we
mean.  He is addressing a body of professing Christians, of
persons baptized in the name of Jesus, and he assumes without the
least caution or qualification that they were really what they
professed to be, true, devoted, regenerate believers. 
“Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that
are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all
that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord,
both theirs and ours.” (1 Cor. i. 2.)  So also, as
baptism was the visible act of union, he assumes that the Holy
Spirit had been pleased to accompany <a id=page12></a><span class=pagenum>p. 12</span>it, and that they had been really
united to their Lord; as, for example, when he says “By one
Spirit are ye all baptized into one body.”  The same
remark may be made of almost every passage in which mention is
made to believers of their baptism.  The Apostles gave free
scope to their affectionate and hopeful interest; they addressed
professors on the assumption that they were in fact what they
were in profession; that they had received the gift of which they
had received the sign and seal.<p>2.  But secondly we may remark, that in the doctrinal
statements of the Word of God the spiritual grace is proved to be
separable from the outward sign.<p>As there are some passages where baptized believers are
addressed, so there are others in which the doctrines of the
gospel are defined and taught.  The former correspond to the
Liturgy, the latter to the Articles of our Church.  It is
very important to observe this distinction; for in the different
classes of passages different modes of expression must be
expected.  Of course the whole of sacred Scripture, being
inspired by the same Spirit, speaks the same truth; but it is one
of the perfections of the Bible that it conveys truth in every
form both of statement and application.  We are bound,
therefore, to study these various forms; and without doing so, we
can never hope either to receive <a id=page13></a><span class=pagenum>p. 13</span>or convey the mind of God.  Now
it is obvious we should naturally look for the principle of
assumption in that class of passages in which our baptismal
privileges are made the subject of personal appeal.  If
regeneration were not assumed, the appeal would be altogether
powerless.  If the writer were to pause to fence in his
argument, and check himself by his expository cautions, the whole
address would be stripped of force and interest.  When St.
Paul, <i>e.g.</i>, with an overflowing heart, writes to the
Colossians, “Put on therefore as the elect of God, holy and
beloved, bowels of mercies, &amp;c.,” he cannot stop to
caution them against presumption, or to point out the necessary
signs of their election.  Just so in addressing baptized
persons, he appeals to them as regenerate without destroying the
force of his address by cautions as to the nature of
regeneration.  Such cautions are given in the doctrinal
passages of the Scriptures.  To these, therefore, we must
turn for exact and dogmatical statements of Christian
truth.  Now, as in the hortatory addresses of the Apostles,
regeneration is invariably assumed until sad facts prove the
contrary; so in the doctrinal statements of the Bible invariable
grace is no less explicitly denied.<p>(1.)  In such passages it is laid down as a general law
of God’s kingdom that no outward ordinances whatever can
invariably convey divine <a id=page14></a><span class=pagenum>p. 14</span>grace.  It is our privilege, as
believers, to expect His presence while in the way of His
judgments we wait for His blessing; but “God is a Spirit
and they that worship must worship Him in spirit and in
truth,” nor are we anywhere warranted in asserting that any
act on man’s part is invariably accompanied with any gift
on God’s part.  He does not bind His gifts to our
actions, even if those actions be hallowed by His own
authority.  Only examine his language respecting all His
appointed ordinances.<p><i>Circumcision</i>.  “He is not a Jew, which is
one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in
the flesh; but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and
circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the
letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.” (Rom. ii.
28, 29.)<p><i>Sacrifice</i>.  Great blessings were attached to
sacrifices, but not invariably; for “The sacrifice of the
wicked is abomination: how much more when he bringeth it with a
wicked mind.” (Prov. xxi. 27.)<p><i>Prayer</i>.  We know the rich promises attached by God
to prayer; but prayer itself may be powerless; for “He that
turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall
be abomination.” (Prov. xxviii. 9.)<p><i>Preaching</i>.  There is scarcely any ordinance to
which such language is applied as is used of preaching.  It
is “the power of God” (1 Cor. i. 18); <a id=page15></a><span class=pagenum>p. 15</span>the channel
by which “faith cometh” (Rom x. 17); an instrument of
the new birth (1 Peter i. 23, 25); and nothing less than a means
of salvation to the hearer (1 Tim. iv. 16).  Yet we must not
argue even from this that the personal benefit is invariable; for
“The preaching of the cross is to them that perish
foolishness.” (1 Cor. i. 18.)<p>But are not the two <i>sacraments</i> an exception? 
Certainly not that of the Lord’s Supper.  The blessing
connected with this sacrament is the highest and choicest of
which the Christian soul is capable, even the communion of the
body and blood of Christ our Saviour.  But this is not
invariably given, for in some cases the communion is a curse and
not a blessing.  “For he that eateth and drinketh
unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not
discerning the Lord’s body.” (1 Cor. xi. 29.)<p>We should gather, therefore, from the harmony of God’s
dealings, that the spiritual grace was not invariably attached to
the outward sign in Baptism.  We find that under every
dispensation He attached certain moral conditions, such as faith
and repentance, which were pre-requisites, to any special grace
conveyed by His ordinances.  If Baptism be an exception to
this general law we should expect to find some statement to this
effect in sacred Scripture.  If there be any deviation from
God’s <a id=page16></a><span class=pagenum>p.
16</span>wonted principles of religious government we should
naturally expect to find the deviation explicitly taught. 
We might reasonably look for some dogmatical passage in which it
is declared that every baptized person is invariably made one
with Christ.  But it we look in vain for such a
passage.  There are texts in which the connexion is assumed,
but we may safely assert that there is not one single passage in
which, as a matter of doctrine, invariability is either taught or
proved.  If, however, it be an exception to the general law,
it must be so from one of two causes.  Either there must be
something peculiar in its nature as a sacrament, which makes the
connexion sacramentally invariable without reference to moral
character, or there must be something in the moral character of
the recipient which invariably insures the blessing.<p>That there is nothing peculiar in its nature as a sacrament is
amply proved by the language of St. Peter.  “The like
figure whereunto baptism doth also now save us (not the putting
away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
conscience towards God), by the resurrection of Jesus
Christ.” (1 Pet iii. 21).  A certain character is here
asserted to be needful in the recipient: the blessing is not
given unless there be the answer of a good conscience towards
God; and there is no sacramental peculiarity which excepts
Baptism <a id=page17></a><span class=pagenum>p.
17</span>from the general law, and attaches the gift invariably
to the sign.<p>It is argued, however, that infants oppose no obstacle to the
operation of Divine grace, and, therefore that in their case the
moral character of the recipient invariably insures the
blessing.  We are not about to discuss this question, for it
is not amongst “the things that are written.” 
There is not a word upon the subject in the Scriptures, and,
therefore, we can only expect to be perplexed and led astray when
we attempt to define and to determine.  This, only, we would
remark—that there is no argument drawn from the moral
innocence of infants to prove their invariable regeneration,
which would not equally prove that Esau was as much a child of
God as Jacob.  They were born on the same day, and of the
same parents; they were circumcised by the same persons under the
same circumstances, and we leave it to those who believe
God’s gifts to become invariable through the moral
innocence of infants to explain the words of God himself,
“Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.” (Rom.
ix. 13.)<p>(2.)  Again, In all the doctrinal passages of Scripture
the new birth is said to be invariably accompanied by holiness of
personal character.<p>Only refer to the first epistle of St. John, “Whosoever
is born of God doth not commit sin, <a id=page18></a><span class=pagenum>p. 18</span>for his seed remaineth in him; and he
cannot sin, because he is born of God.  In this the children
of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever
doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not
his brother.” (1 John iii. 9, 10.)  “Everyone
that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.  He that loveth
not, knoweth not God; for God is love.” (1 John iv. 7,
8.)  “Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world:
and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
faith.” (1 John v. 4.)  “We know that whosoever
is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God
keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.” (1
John v. 18.)<p>There are some acknowledged difficulties in these passages;
but we make a fearless appeal to any unprejudiced mind: do they
not teach beyond the possibility of controversy that the man
without faith and without love is not born of God, and that we
have no scriptural warrant for calling those regenerate who grow
up in sin, who spend their strength in sin, and who go to the
grave with the curse of unrepented sin upon their heads?<p>(3.)  The practice of the Apostles accords with these
doctrinal statements.  They always assumed regeneration in
baptized professors until sad facts proved the contrary; but
there was a limit to this <a id=page19></a><span class=pagenum>p. 19</span>assumption.  And when these sad
facts occurred, they declared in language the most explicit that
such characters were not regenerate by God.<p>The language of St. Peter to Simon Magus in Acts viii, 21, is
not addressed to him as to a regenerate man in a state of
inconsistency; but to an unregenerate man in a state of false
profession.  In one sense Simon had believed.  Like the
devils he had been convinced, but he had no union with his
Saviour either before his baptism or after it; and though on the
principle of assumption the inspired Apostle had sanctioned his
baptism on his profession, on the principle of Christian truth he
pronounced him reprobate on the manifestation of his sin. 
“Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter; for thy
heart is not right in the sight of God.”<p>The language of the Apostle Paul to the Corinthians is of the
same character.  In 2 Cor. xiii, 5, he says, “Examine
yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own
selves.  Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ
is in you, except ye be reprobates?”  The word here
rendered “reprobate” is the word which would be
applied to false coinage when tested and found wanting. 
Those, therefore, who were not in the faith were regarded by St.
Paul not as regenerate persons who were inconsistent, but as base
metal; persons who bore the outward sign of Christianity, <a id=page20></a><span class=pagenum>p. 20</span>but who were
not really regenerate, and were, therefore, enjoying no real
union with the Lord Jesus.<p>Just so St. John wrote of those who had apostatized from the
faith. (1 John ii, 19.)  “They went out from us, but
they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no
doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might
be made manifest that they were not all of us.”  In
these words there are three things carefully to be
observed.  First: The persons alluded to must have been
baptized professors, who at one time had been in fellowship with
the Apostles, for it is quite impossible to suppose them
unbaptized at the time when they were “with us,”
<i>i.e.</i> in union and communion with the Church. 
Secondly: These persons had broken off from this communion, and
were openly antichristian in their principles.  Thirdly: St.
John explains their conduct upon the principle that they had
never been what they had professed to be, and describes their
desertion of the truth as a manifestation of their real, though
previously hidden, character.  On the principle of
assumption they had been received into the fellowship of the
Church of God; but they were condemned as reprobates as soon as
sad facts made manifest the falsehood of their profession. 
We should not fear to rest the whole question of invariable
regeneration in baptism <a id=page21></a><span class=pagenum>p. 21</span>upon this one single text.  It
is impossible to suppose them unbaptized, and with the inspired
Word before us it is equally impossible to regard them as
regenerate.<p>While, therefore, in their hortatory addresses the inspired
Apostles always assumed the gift to have been imparted whenever
the sacrament had been received, in their doctrinal statements of
Divine truth they taught plainly that baptized unbelievers are
not to be regarded as regenerate, and that in accordance with the
general law of God’s kingdom the outward sign of Baptism
may be unaccompanied by the inward gift.<p>We proceed, then, to our next subject of inquiry, namely, the
teaching of the Church of England.<p>As Churchmen we cannot fail to be most deeply interested in
the truth and consistency of our Church’s system; and when
we see it attacked on the one hand, and misapplied on the other,
it is truly refreshing to the spirit to be able to bring it
fearlessly to the test of God’s unerring word.  By the
Bible, then, let us boldly try the<h3>PRAYER BOOK.</h3><p>In such an inquiry it is our first duty to ascertain what the
Prayer Book itself teaches.  We care not what men say,
write, or think respecting <a id=page22></a><span class=pagenum>p. 22</span>it; our business is with the real
doctrine of the book itself, “in the plain and full meaning
thereof.”  We will adopt the same arrangement as
before, and endeavour to ascertain<p>I.  What is the gift connected by the Church with the
sacrament of Baptism?<p>II.  What is the nature of the connection?<p>I.  As in the Scriptures, so in the Prayer Book, the gift
connected is said to be a saving union with out Lord Jesus
Christ.<p>“Wherein I was made a member of Christ, the child of
God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of
heaven.”—<i>Catechism</i>.<p>“And humbly we beseech Thee to grant, that he, being
dead unto sin, and living unto righteous, and being buried with
Christ in his death (taken from Rom. vi.), may crucify the old
man, &amp;c.”—<i>Baptismal Service</i>.<p>As in the Scriptures, so in the Prayer Book, this union with
Christ in supposed to lead invariably to the two changes above
stated, viz., a change of condition, and a change heart.<h3>CHANGE OF CONDITION.</h3><p>“They that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the
Church; the promises of forgiveness of sin, and of an adoption to
be the sons of God, by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and
sealed: <a id=page23></a><span class=pagenum>p.
23</span>Faith is confirmed, and grace increased by virtue of
prayer to God.”—<i>Art.</i> 27.<p>“Regard, we beseech Thee, the supplications of thy
congregation, sanctify this water to the mystical washing away of
sin (from Acts xxii. 16), and grant that this child now to be
baptized therein may receive the fulness of Thy grace, and ever
remain in the number of Thy faithful and elect children, through
Jesus Christ our Lord.”—<i>Baptismal Service</i>.<p>“We give Thee thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath
pleased Thee to regenerate this infant with Thy Holy Spirit, to
receive him for Thine own child by adoption, and to incorporate
him into Thy holy Church.”—<i>Baptismal
Service</i>.<h3>CHARGE OF NATURE.</h3><p>“What is the inward and spiritual grace?<p>“A death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness;
for, being by nature born in sin and the children of wrath, we
are hereby made the children of
grace.”—<i>Catechism</i>.<p>“O merciful God, grant that the old Adam in this child
may be so buried that the new man may be raised up in
him.”<p>“Grant that all carnal affections may die in him, and
that all things belonging to the Spirit may live and grow in
him.”—<i>Baptismal Service</i>.<p>There is nowhere In the Prayer Book, any more <a id=page24></a><span class=pagenum>p. 24</span>than in the
Bible, the smallest allusion to the idea of a certain spiritual
seed being implanted at Baptism, which may or may not grow in
after life.  Both agree in looking for the highest gifts,
and the highest gifts alone.  We do not pray that the child
may be put merely into a new position, which he may use or not,
as it may happen, but that he “may be born again, and be
made an heir of everlasting salvation.”  We look for a
permanent, lasting, saving change; viz., adoption into
God’s family, regeneration by the Holy Ghost.<p>And as for the idea that the Church looks for baptismal
justification without a change of heart as its necessary and
invariable accompaniment, we would only ask the advocates of such
a theory to explain, if they can, the language of the Catechism,
which says that “the inward and spiritual grace is a death
unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness.”  Never,
surely, does the Church of England teach that there can be such a
death and such a life without an inward and sanctifying change by
the Holy Ghost.<p>II.  As to the gift itself, therefore, there is complete
agreement.  The great subject of discussion, however, is the
connexion.  By some it is thought invariable, at least in
the case of infants; <i>i.e.</i>, it is maintained that every
baptized infant is there and then, ipso facto, regenerate. 
Our present object is to shew that such a theory is at variance
<a id=page25></a><span class=pagenum>p. 25</span>with the
teaching of the Church, for that the inward gift, though assumed
upon profession, is explicitly taught to be separable from the
outward sign.<p>1.  The spiritual gift is assumed to have been received
whenever the outward sacrament has been administered.  The
whole of our services are constructed upon this principle. 
We are all baptized upon a profession of our faith, and all meet
in the house of God in the character of baptized believers; the
Church, therefore, as a public body, is bound to assume our
profession real.  This it does in all its services; so that
there is not a single prayer throughout the Liturgy which is not
drawn up on the principle of assumption.  Upon this
principle persons are supposed at their burial to have been
believers, as they are assumed in their confessions to be
repentant, and at their baptism to be regenerate.  Indeed it
may be laid down as a general rule that whenever there is
anything personal in the bearing of a passage, the person
affected is always assumed to be in fact what he is in
profession.<p>This principle of assumption appears as plainly in the
Catechism as the Liturgy.  There is a great distinction to
be observed between the language of the Articles and the
Catechism.  The Articles teach truth abstractedly—the
Catechism in its personal application to the individual who
employs <a id=page26></a><span class=pagenum>p.
26</span>the words.  In the Catechism, therefore, grace is
always assumed.  The child is assumed to be a true believer
and to be living in the constant habit of thankful prayer, as for
example in the words, “I heartily thank our heavenly
Father, that He hath called me to this state of salvation,
through Jesus Christ our Saviour: And I pray unto God to give me
His grace that I may continue in the same unto my life’s
end.”<p>Upon the same principle he is assumed in the second answer to
have been made in baptism “a member of Christ,”
&amp;c.  The fourth answer is manifestly drawn up on the
principle of assumption; it declares what ought to be, and
assumes that it is, the child’s character.  The second
answer must, in common consistency, mean the same; and it would
be just as reasonable to maintain that the Church teaches the
invariable prayerfulness of every child who repeats the
Catechism, as the invariable regeneration of even child received
into its fold by baptism.<p>Now this principle of assumption is exactly that which we
discover in the addresses of the Apostle.  Thus far,
therefore, there is agreement between the Bible and the Prayer
Book.<p>2.  As a matter of doctrine, the Prayer Book teaches,
like the Bible, that the spiritual gift is <a id=page27></a><span class=pagenum>p. 27</span>not
invariably given in connexion with the outward sign.<p>Upon such a subject our chief reference should obviously be to
the Articles.  They correspond to the doctrinal teaching of
the Scriptures, the Liturgy to the devotional and hortatory
addresses.  In the Articles alone there is no personal
application, and, therefore, they alone are free from the
principle of assumption.  As we have before remarked, they
deal with abstract truth; and contain a scheme of theology
carefully drawn up for the security of the Church.  To them,
therefore, we are bound in common sense to refer for all
dogmatical assertions as to the doctrinal principles of our
Church.<p>Now it is quite impossible for any language to be simpler and
clearer than that of the Articles.<p>Of both sacraments it is said, Art. 25, “In such only as
worthily receive the same they have a wholesome effect and
operation; for they that receive them unworthily purchase to
themselves damnation, as St. Paul saith.”  And of
Baptism, Art. 27, “It is a sign of regeneration or new
birth, whereby, as by an instrument, they that receive baptism
rightly are grafted into the Church.”<p>The doctrine of these passages exactly corresponds with that
of Scripture.  They deny in the plainest possible language
the invariability of the <a id=page28></a><span class=pagenum>p. 28</span>connexion; they define the two
sacraments by the same conditions; they make not the most distant
allusion to any sacramental peculiarity in baptism; but assert of
both with the most positive distinctness, that in such only as
worthily receive the same they have a wholesome effect and
operation.<p>Nor is there any exception in the case of infants.  Our
Reformers in framing the Articles adhered most resolutely to
their Bibles, and when the word of God was silent they were
silent also.  There is no exception respecting infants in
the Scriptures; there is none therefore in the Articles. 
They state as much as, and no more than, the word of God itself
instructs them.  Nay more, it is plain, both from the
Catechism and the Baptismal Service, that no such distinction is
recognized.  The Catechism does not set aside the necessity
of faith and repentance in the case of infancy, but supposes it
satisfied by the promise of the sureties.  So, also, in the
Baptismal Service, the same questions are asked as are asked of
adults.  There is not the least distinction in respect of
infancy; nor the least hint at invariable moral qualification,
setting aside the necessity of a positive declaration of the
Christian faith.  Of course there are difficulties connected
with the baptism of unconscious children, but these have nothing
to do with our present subject.  <a id=page29></a><span class=pagenum>p. 29</span>All that we are now concerned with is
the fact that our Church makes no distinction in their favour,
but that in every instant she requires a certain confession, and
thereby in every instance denies the invariability of the
connexion between the inward gift and the outward sign. <a id=citation29></a><a class="citation pginternal" href=#footnote29>[29]</a><p>Again, therefore, we find complete and exact agreement between
the Prayer Book and the Bible.  In all personal passages the
connexion is assumed.  In doctrinal statements moral
conditions are required, and the invariability of the connexion
is denied.<p>This distinction is the simple key to the two passages in the
Baptismal Service which have <a id=page30></a><span class=pagenum>p. 30</span>occasioned so much discussion. 
“Seeing, now, dearly beloved, that this child is
regenerate.”  “We yield Thee hearty thanks, most
merciful Father, that it hath pleased Thee to regenerate this
infant with Thy Holy Spirit, to receive him for Thine own child
by adoption, and to incorporate him into Thy holy
Church.”<p>If the preceding argument be correct, the question with
reference to these passages is obviously reduced to this: Are
they the language of strong faith assuming the gift given when
the outward act had been duly performed?  Or, are they a
dogmatical statement of the doctrine that every baptized infant
is by that act regenerate by the Holy Ghost?<p>It can scarcely be denied that the prayer is drawn up in the
spirit of assumption; we may confine the question, therefore, to
the declaration.  Now, if there be any truth in the rule
that where there is anything personal in a passage, the person
affected is always assumed to be in fact what he is in
profession, it must apply to these words which are pre-eminently
personal in their character.  Earnest prayer has just been
offered; the Church has done her utmost to arouse the spirit of
repenting faith; a declaration of faith and repentance has just
been made; and the sole object of the sentence is to move the
congregation to united thanksgiving and prayer.  Assumption,
therefore, <a id=page31></a><span class=pagenum>p.
31</span>is absolutely necessary to the construction of the
service; thanksgiving would be impossible without it; and if, in
such circumstances, the Church did not assume the gift, she must
be compelled to stop the mouth of God’s faithful children,
when they would pour forth the gratitude of a hopeful and
overflowing heart.<p>This view of the passage is confirmed by the similar
assumption in the corresponding prayer after the reception of the
other sacrament “Almighty and everliving God, we most
heartily thank Thee, for that Thou dost vouchsafe to feed us, who
have duly received these holy mysteries with the spiritual food
of the most precious body and blood of Thy Son our Saviour Jesus
Christ,” &amp;c.  Here are two assumptions—1st,
That all the communicants have received the sacrament duly; and
2nd, That they have all been fed with the spiritual grace of
which it is a sign.  But no one with the Articles before him
can suppose that the Church intended to teach that every
communicant invariably feeds on the most precious body and blood
of Christ.<p>At the same time it may be proved, with the certainty of
mathematical demonstration, that these words are not the language
of assertion.  It cannot be believed, with the 25th and 27th
Articles before us, that our Church asserts the invariability of
regeneration in all adults who are <a id=page32></a><span class=pagenum>p. 32</span>baptized.  No language could be
more decisive or distinct than theirs.  “In such only
as worthily receive the same they have a wholesome effect and
operation.”  But on turning to the Service of Baptism
for Adults, we find the very same words used as are employed for
infants, “Now that this person is regenerate.” 
It must be obvious to any man, that if these words are to be
understood as a positive doctrinal assertion of invariable
regeneration in adults, they are in flat contradiction to the
Articles.  If they are intended to assert the doctrine that
every baptized adult is regenerate, they are in exact and direct
opposition to the passages quoted above, which teach most
carefully that every baptized adult is not regenerate.  If
this be the real meaning of our Service, the Prayer Book, in this
matter, flatly contradicts itself.  If, on the other hand,
the passage in the Baptismal Service be the language of
assumption, all is harmonious.  In its statement of
doctrine, the Church gives the caution; in its application to the
individual, it confidently and unreservedly assumes the
gift.  In the case of adults, therefore, the language must
be that of assumption, not assertion.  But there is an exact
identity between the words used for infants and adults.  In
this respect there is not a shade of difference between the two
offices.  “Now that this child is regenerate,”
says the one; “Now that this person is regenerate,”
says the other.  Is <a id=page33></a><span class=pagenum>p. 33</span>it consistent, is it logical, is it
common sense, to say that one thing is meant in one passage, and
another thing in another?  That one thing is meant on the
81st page, and a totally different thing by the same words on the
84th page of the same book?  That one is assertion, while
the other is admitted to be assumption?  Common sense
demands that in the same book, the same words should mean the
same thing.  The two passages must therefore be either both
assumption or both assertion.  Assertion is impossible in
the one, and, therefore, assumption is logically necessary in
both.<p>There is, therefore, throughout the Prayer Book a beautiful
agreement with the Bible.  They both, in hortatory passages,
assume regeneration where faith has been professed, and the
sacrament administered.  They both in doctrinal statements
teach distinctly that baptized persons are not all
regenerate.  The Churchman needs no more than this agreement
for the satisfaction of his conscience.  There may be one or
two expressions which he may wish could be so modified as to make
clear at a glance the Church’s meaning without the
necessity of comparing them with the Articles.  But still,
on the great Protestant principle of the sovereign supremacy of
the Bible it is enough for him that the Liturgy is scriptural,
and that the Word of God has supplied the model for its
construction.  It is scriptural in its silence, <a id=page34></a><span class=pagenum>p. 34</span>in its
assumptions, in its assertions.  It says nothing where the
Bible gives no guide, and therefore makes no distinction between
adults and infants; it assumes where the Bible assumes, and
therefore speaks of all baptized persons as regenerate; and with
the Bible as its authority, it asserts, in language the most
unequivocal and explicit, that baptized persons are not
invariably regenerate, for that the gifts of divine grace are not
invariably connected with either of the sacraments which God has
appointed in His Church.<div class=gapspace> </div><div class=gapshortline> </div><p style=text-align:center><span class=GutSmall>J. FLETCHER,

baptismal service is sometimes quoted in opposition to the above
statements.  “It is certain from God’s word,
that children which are baptized, dying before they commit actual
sin, are undoubtedly saved.”  From this it is argued,
that the Church does enter into the particular case of infants,
and teach their invariable regeneration.  “If
saved,” it is said, “they must be justified—and
if justified regenerate.  Hence, as the Church declares all
dying children to be saved, she teaches thereby that all baptized
children are regenerate.”  The unsoundness of such an
argument is best seen by following it to its conclusions: for it
would be quite as sound reasoning to say that if justified they
must be believers, and if believers, possessed of judgment and
responsibility.  The fallacy lies in this: it is taken for
granted that God applies the saving blood of Christ in the same
way, and the same way alone, to unconscious infants and
responsible adults.  As there is no foundation for this in
Scripture, the whole argument falls to the ground.  Would
that churchmen were content to follow the example of our Church,
to accept the assurance of infant salvation without straining it
into a system, or attempting to define what God has left

from people in all walks of life.</div><div>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Literary Archive Foundation</div><div>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</div><div>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href=https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/>www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</div><div>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</div><div>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</div><div>Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</div><div class=secthead>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</div><div>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</div><div>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</div><div>Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href=https://www.gutenberg.org>www.gutenberg.org</a>.</div><div>This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</div><button id=scroller onclick=topFunction()>&#8593;</button>
