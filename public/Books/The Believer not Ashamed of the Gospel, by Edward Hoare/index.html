one that believeth</i>.”—Romans i. 16.</div></blockquote><div class=gapshortline> </div><p><span class=smcap>There</span> is nothing more strange than
human nature.  It is afraid where no fear is: yet bold in
the midst of danger.  It is ashamed where there is no
disgrace; and yet shameless, when it ought to be abased, even to
the dust.  It is proud of things which do it no honour, and
yet ashamed of gifts which are the wonder and admiration of the
saints in heaven.  If a man is possessed of great
intellectual attainments, he is never found to be ashamed of
them!  If he is successful in the accumulation of wealth, he
is never known to be ashamed of that; if he is remarkable for
worldly wisdom, he is never tempted to be ashamed of that; nor,
if he deduces his pedigree from a long line of ennobled ancestry,
does he show any tendency to be ashamed of that.  But if, on
the other hand, he be made partaker of the highest gift that the
world has ever known—the gift of the grace of God in his
heart—the most blessed and glorious gift within the reach
either of man or angel—then, strange to say! such is the
folly of human nature, that he is strongly tempted to be ashamed
of that; ashamed of the deep emotions which the Spirit of God has
kindled within his soul, ashamed of that which, in the secrets <a id=page2></a><span class=pagenum>p. 2</span>of his own
heart, he acknowledges to be his hope, his joy, his salvation,
and his glory.<p>Now this is no new thing in the church of Christ, and the
words of the text are a clear recognition of its existence in the
days, and even in the heart, of St. Paul.  He was not
“ashamed of the Gospel of Christ.”  But the
temptation was there; the sense of shame <i>did</i> arise in his
heart, and <i>did</i> struggle there; but the grace of God
overcame it.  So that in allusion to this victory, he makes
the declaration of the text.  Now what does this declaration
imply? and what is the full force of the sentiment contained in
it?  Clearly that he was not ashamed of confessing Christ,
and of acknowledging, before both Jew and Gentile, that his whole
life was wrapt up in Christ.  Nay, more! that he was not
ashamed of preaching Christ, of consecrating his every power to
the holy work of proclaiming Christ before the world.  The
text, therefore, appears well suited for an address to the Church
of England Young Men’s Society, as I trust it may be said
of the great body of young men composing it, that they are not
“ashamed of the Gospel of Christ;” not ashamed of
confessing Him before men, nor of uniting together, as a holy
band of faithful labourers, in the earnest endeavour to spread
His Gospel through the world.<p>Let us examine, then, into the reasons why St. Paul was not
“ashamed of the Gospel of Christ,” and we shall find
three especially mentioned in the text—the Divinity of its
origin, the blessedness of its end, and the magnificence of its
terms.<div class=gapspace> </div><p>I.  <i>The Divinity of its origin</i>.  “I am
not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the <i>power of
God</i>.”  By which he means that it is no human
system, but a Divine scheme, divinely planned and purposed; a
scheme contrived by no human wisdom, nor carried into effect by
any human power; a scheme Divine in its plan, Divine in its
execution, and Divine in its application to the soul.  The
purpose was His, arranged in His own eternal counsels; the
execution was His, <a id=page3></a><span class=pagenum>p.
3</span>and His alone to perform the vast work by which atonement
and mediation could be provided for the sinner; the application
again is His, for who but Himself can really bring home the
Gospel with appropriating power to the soul, can really touch the
hard heart, and soften down the rebellious sinner into the humble
and believing child of God?  The whole, therefore, is
Divine; from first to last it is the work of God; and thus it
stands out, far above every other system, as the most marvellous
combination, which the world has ever witnessed, of Divine
wisdom, Divine love, and Divine omnipotence.<p>There are many practical lessons to be learned from such a
fact.<p>It should teach us, in the first place, the proper limits of
human inquiry with reference to the Gospel.  We must never
forget that the human understanding has its own most important
sphere of action, and that its enlightened exercise is essential
to the right reception of the truth of God.  We are not at
liberty, for example, to shut up the understanding, and deliver
ourselves blindfold to the guidance of any church which may call
itself infallible, but we are bound as thinking men to examine
the credentials of its assumed infallibility.  And so with
reference to the Word of God itself, it is our manifest duty to
study well the proofs of its inspiration, and the careful
examination of scriptural evidences is a legitimate and noble
theme for the diligent exercise of an enlightened
understanding.  Then again the understanding must be
employed in the patient study of the contents of the inspired
Book.  Having learned that it is the Book of God, we must
next inquire what it teaches, and being satisfied that it
contains the truth, we must proceed to examine what the truth is
which it contains.  But this truth being once ascertained,
the understanding must immediately give place to faith, and the
inquiring spirit must simply believe what the inspired Word is
found to teach him.  The Gospel is the power of God, and
therefore the human mind must be prepared to find in it many
things altogether beyond its range.  If it <a id=page4></a><span class=pagenum>p. 4</span>were the work
of man we should of course expect to find the whole within the
compass of man’s intellect; but as it is the power of God,
His own plan and His own purpose, we must be prepared to meet
with deep and unfathomable truths, bearing some proportion to His
infinite and unfathomable attributes.  Thus, for example,
our finite minds are unable to comprehend the great mystery of
the incarnation, or how one person can be at the same time both
God and man; but such a difficulty is no stumbling-block to the
believer, for though by reason he cannot understand it, yet he
finds it written in the Scriptures, and by faith he receives it,
for the Gospel is the power of God.  It was the neglect of
this principle that led to the error of the Sadducees, as we are
taught by our Lord in the twenty-second chapter of St. Matthew,
and the twenty-ninth verse: “Ye do err, not knowing the
Scriptures, nor the power of God.”  They had not
employed their understanding when they ought to have done so,
namely, in the investigation of their Bibles, but they had
employed it where it could give them no safe guidance, namely, in
vain speculation on fancied difficulties in the plans and
purposes of God.  To avoid a similar error we must bear in
mind that the Gospel, being Divine in its origin, is likewise
superhuman in its arrangements, and we must adhere strictly to
the great principle of diligent investigation when we want to
know what God has taught us, and of simple faith when we have
once discovered the vast truths revealed to us by His Spirit.<p>Again, the fact that the Gospel is the power of God should
fill our hearts with hope in every effort for its extension; and
we find it so employed by the Lord when He taught us in His
prayer to urge it as an argument for the speedy coming of His
kingdom.  We may observe that the spread of the Lord’s
kingdom has always required men to make attempts apparently
beyond the reach of human power.  Nothing, for example,
could have appeared less probable eighteen hundred years ago than
that the whole of civilized Europe should be more or less
controlled by the preaching of twelve ill-educated <a id=page5></a><span class=pagenum>p. 5</span>fishermen on
the shores of Galilee; but so it is; and for the simple reason
that “the Gospel is the power of God.”  It would
have appeared at first sight next to impossible that such an one
as William Tyndale, a private tutor in a gentleman’s family
in Gloucestershire, should break down the barrier which Rome had
raised against the circulation of the Scriptures, and force the
New Testament into this country in spite of the united powers of
Henry, of Wolsey, of the nobility of England, and the hierarchy
of Rome.  But the Gospel was the power of God, and the
humble private tutor triumphed.  Nothing could have appeared
more hopeless to all human calculation than the mission of Mr.
Marsden, when he first landed among the cannibals of New Zealand,
and saw lying stranded on the shore the hull of a vessel whose
unfortunate crew had been recently devoured by the islanders; but
he landed there in faith, and because the Gospel is “the
power of God,” the island has been won to the sovereignty
of our Queen, and a noble church gathered out to the glory of the
Lord.  So in all our present efforts we must ever bear in
mind that our weapon, the simple Gospel of the Lord Jesus, is not
a human but Divine instrumentality, and we must endeavour to go
forth to our work in the same spirit in which Morrison went to
China, of whom it is related, that, when asked on one occasion,
“Do you expect to convert the Chinese?” he replied,
“No, but I expect that the Lord will.”  There
may be many hindrances, for example, in the way of the
Jews’ conversion, and much to dishearten the devoted
labourer in the dense masses of our manufacturing population, but
who need be discouraged when he strives to preach a Saviour, and
remembers that his simple message is the mighty power of an
omnipotent God?  And so with reference to the great
principles of the Reformation, those principles so inexpressibly
dear to the heart of every scriptural believer, there may be much
to alarm in all we see around us; in the many adversaries, some
open, and some secret; some in undisguised opposition to the
truth, and some professing it, it is much to be feared, for the
unhallowed purpose of betraying it.  Yes! <a id=page6></a><span class=pagenum>p. 6</span>there is much
to be feared; but there is much more to be hoped for by the
Christian; for our weapons are Divine; our trust is in the Word
of God, the truth of God, the grace of God; and therefore we may
go on our way fearlessly, peacefully, hopefully, joyously, for we
know where our strength lies, in the Gospel of the Lord Jesus,
which is the power of God unto salvation.<div class=gapspace> </div><p>II.  We may pass on then to the second reason why we
should not be ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, namely, the
blessedness of its end.  It is the power of God “unto
salvation.”  Now what is meant by this
salvation?  It must not be limited to one particular act of
God or to another, but includes the whole work of Divine grace in
the soul, commencing with the new birth, and about to be
perfected at the glorious appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ.  When a man is accepted in Christ Jesus, and born
again of God the Holy Spirit, then is that poor sinner declared
in the Scripture to be saved.  He is saved, for he is
adopted into the family of God, and he no longer stands condemned
as a guilty, sinful, child of wrath; “to as many as
received Him to them gave He power to become the sons of God,
even to them that believe on His name.”  He is saved,
for he has a new life bestowed on him, which all the powers of
death shall never be able to extinguish, for he is “born
again not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word
of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”  He is
saved, for he is born to be a conqueror; so that although there
may be a deep struggle in the secrets of his heart, and many a
strong temptation alluring him from his course, and exerting such
a power over his soul, that he trembles at times lest he should
be plunged again into the abyss of sin; yet through it all he
comes forth a conqueror, and the Scriptures are proved true,
which declare without reserve, “Whatsoever is born of God
overcometh the world.”  Nay, more!  He is saved,
for he is adopted into a coheirship with his Lord.  He
passes through life like other men, engaged in interests,
afflicted by its sorrows, and <a id=page7></a><span class=pagenum>p. 7</span>partaking of its joys.  You meet
him in society, and you observe no marked distinction, except in
his character.  But all the while the hidden seal is on his
forehead, the Father’s name is written there, and the
quiet, humble believer, with nothing here to attract attention,
is in the sight of God a child of God; and is destined to reign
triumphant in the approaching kingdom of his Lord: “If
children, then heirs, heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
Christ.”<p>But this is merely the first step in the great
salvation.  The living believer, though saved, is in the
midst of his warfare.  He may be confident of victory, but
he dare not lay aside his armour.  We must look forward
therefore to the time when his struggle will be over, and his
victory perfected in Christ; when his ransomed spirit shall take
its place in the great multitude, who stand in the presence, and
behold the glory of the Lord.  How many are there that have
stood beside the open grave, grieving, and bitterly grieving, for
the loss of those over whose remains it was about to close! 
But how would that grief be soothed, could we only see beyond the
veil, and there witness the joy of the new born spirit, no longer
struggling against sin, nor bowed down by its heavy burden; no
more contending against its subtlety, nor compelled to confess
its power; but welcomed there to uninterrupted blessedness, a
spotless spirit in the joy and presence of the Lord.<p>But even this is not all.  It is enough to fill our
hearts with gladness to know that the departed spirit rests in
perfect peace before the throne of God; but there are blessings
richer still in store for all the saints of God.  There is a
time coming when there shall be no division in the family, nor
any great gulf between the brethren assembled before the throne,
and the brethren still struggling upon earth; but when the whole
of God’s elect shall be gathered; when the Jew, the
European, the African, and the New Zealander, will all be
assembled into one company, to bow before one throne, to speak
one language, and to join in one universal hymn of praise to the
one Author of their eternal life.  Then again <a id=page8></a><span class=pagenum>p. 8</span>each individual
will be perfected.  There will not then be merely the spirit
in separation from the flesh, but it will be reunited to the
risen body, as pure, as spotless, as incorruptible as
itself.  And who can realize the joy of that wonderful day,
when all shall be gathered, so that no single individual of the
whole family shall be absent, and all shall be perfected, so that
throughout the whole multitude there shall not be found a single
spot or stain of sin—when the whole corruption of our
nature shall be gone, the whole effect of that corruption gone
likewise, and the whole church of God created anew in the perfect
likeness and image of the Lord?  Such is the great, the
complete salvation.  And the present means for compassing
this mighty end is the simple preaching of the Gospel of the Lord
Jesus.  Men go forth with stammering lips, and multiplied
deficiencies; but God is blessing their message for the
ingathering of His own elect, and the final completion of His own
glory.  So that notwithstanding all defects, we may look
onwards to the great result, and say with St. Paul—“I
am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of
God unto salvation.”<div class=gapspace> </div><p>III.  But, following the guidance of the text, we are led
to a third reason why we should not be ashamed of the Gospel,
namely, <i>the magnificence of its terms</i>.  “It is
the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to
the Jew first and also to the Greek.”<p>It is in human nature to admire anything that is grand and
glorious.  The heavens, the sea, the mountains, command our
admiration by the beauty of their appearance, and the vastness of
their scale.  But in the whole range of the works of God,
there is nothing to be compared in grandeur with the Gospel of
Christ.  It is the most perfect display of the most perfect
and holy of His attributes.  If it be inquired which is the
greatest of all His holy attributes, it will not be found to be
His omnipotence or His omniscience, but that in which all the
rest are summed up by the inspired Word, when it says, “God
is love.”  And if, again, it be inquired how <a id=page9></a><span class=pagenum>p. 9</span>this crowning
attribute has been most abundantly exhibited, we shall not find
our answer either in creation or in providence, but in “the
height and depth and length and breadth of the love of Christ,
which passeth knowledge.”  “Herein is love, not
that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be
the propitiation for our sins.”<p>Now this love is displayed in the Gospel, according to the
language of the text, both in the extent of the offer, and the
freedom of its terms.<p>In the <i>extent of its offer</i>; for there is no limitation
of any kind whatever, but the door is thrown open to every one
that believeth, to whatever nation it may be his portion to
belong.  It is “the power of God unto salvation, to
every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the
Greek.”  There is none excluded, nor any who possesses
a peculiar interest in the promise.  It is, indeed, preached
first to the Jew; but he has no exclusive interest in its
blessing, for the Greek, or Gentile, is accepted on the same
terms, and made partaker of the same inestimable gifts.  It
is well, therefore, that we should strive to stir up each
other’s hearts in the work of missions, both to the Jews
and to the heathens; to the colonists in distant lands, and to
the great masses of our uninstructed countrymen at home. 
The Gospel is the same power to all classes and in all
lands.  The Jew may long strive to work out a salvation for
himself, and rest content in his own most sinful righteousness;
but let the grace of God touch his heart, and he will find the
Gospel to be the power of God unto his salvation, while he
kneels, in faith and deep humiliation, before the throne of his
crucified and risen Lord.  The manufacturer may be for a
time lost in the midst of the dense population with which he is
surrounded, having his mind soured by the preachers of sedition,
and his heart estranged from God through the deadly teaching of
the Chartist and the Socialist; but let the earnest pastor convey
to him in his own home, or preach to him in the church, the
life-giving Gospel of the Lord, and it is found to be the power
of God unto his salvation; so that the bold <a id=page10></a><span class=pagenum>p. 10</span>blasphemer
becomes the meek, the humble, the believing child of God. 
So again with our colonists.  They are a class of persons
for whom we should feel the most tender sympathy.  Many of
them are compelled to leave their country on account of poverty;
and then, settling in some distant settlement, are wholly cut off
from their wonted enjoyment of the means of grace.  Many who
once loved the house of God at home, now rarely hear the voice of
the minister; and, if ever they enjoy the blessing of the
communion, can only hope for it after the long interval of many
years.  But the Gospel is the power of God unto their
salvation; and it is delightful to realise the joy felt by
multitudes of thirsting souls, when the faithful missionary
arrives on his long-expected visit, and sets forth, in rich
simplicity, the unsearchable riches of Christ.  So again to
the poor African, the unhappy captive of that wicked slave-trade,
torn from his home, his wife, his children, his all that is dear
to him on earth, is the same Gospel brought home with the same
power.  It is a shame that the heart of every Englishman is
not moved to its very core, by the awful miseries inflicted by
that most guilty traffic; and, while we look at the apathy of the
Christian church upon the subject, we may well exclaim,
‘Where is the spirit of Clarkson and William Wilberforce,
of Buxton and Zachary Macaulay?’  Why are we not all
stirring heart and soul to remove such a curse from human
nature?  There is a joy, however, in placing the happy peace
of the believing African, in bright contrast to the dark horrors
of the abominable traffic, and in following the liberated captive
on his way, till we find him in one of the Sierra Leone churches;
a holy believer, a living, happy, triumphant, witness that the
Gospel of the Lord Jesus is the power of God unto salvation.<p>But the real beauty of the Gospel consists in the <i>freedom
of its terms</i>, as expressed in the latter part of the
text:—“to every one that believeth.” 
These words show that salvation is granted freely without any
preparatory qualification in the sinner; and if this one feature
in it were changed, it would <a id=page11></a><span class=pagenum>p. 11</span>at once be stripped of all its
excellence and power.  Suppose, for example, that the text
were otherwise expressed, and that it were said, “The
Gospel is the power of God unto salvation, to every one that
<i>repenteth</i>:” we could never then have laid hold on a
Saviour’s love, until we had ascertained a clear evidence,
in our own soul, of a repentance so perfect as to be satisfactory
before God; or, in other words, we should have been for ever cut
off from mercy.  Or suppose it had been written, “to
every one that loves:” we must then have turned our
thoughts inwards for a strict scrutiny of our own affections, and
although we desired with the whole heart to love the Lord, we
should have found there so much of cold apathy, that we should
have been compelled to the conclusion that the great salvation
could never be for us.  Or suppose that the common low
standard of the world had been adopted, and the text had been
written, “to every one that does all in his power to
deserve it:” where, we ask, is that man who has even
fulfilled this low requirement, and who would not through his
manifold defects and deficiencies, be for ever excluded from the
covenant?  But thanks be to God, the text says, “to
every one that believeth!”  Now faith is the act of
the lost soul in laying hold on Christ.  The Gospel
therefore requires no preparatory fitness, it does not bid us
wait till we repent enough, or till we love enough, or till we
have endeavoured enough; but it does bid us trust, as we are, to
the Saviour who died for us; and it does assure us, because He
made a perfect atonement for the whole of our sin, that
“whosoever believeth on Him, shall not perish, but have
everlasting life.”  This one great truth is the very
key-stone of the Gospel; and let any poor, guilty, brokenhearted
sinner only learn through God’s grace what it is to accept
that free pardon in faith, and then it will be strange, indeed,
if he cannot enter into the spirit of the apostle, when he
declares, “I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: for it
is the power of God unto salvation.”<p>Now let us thank God that there is in this metropolis a body
of young men, to the number of about 1,200, and in other <a id=page12></a><span class=pagenum>p. 12</span>parts of the
country to the number of about 1,200 more, who are not ashamed of
the Gospel; not ashamed of the broken heart,—not ashamed of
being called saints,—not ashamed of uniting together heart
and soul in the earnest endeavour to spread the glad tidings of a
free salvation through the world.  May the Lord prosper
their work, and give them all an experimental knowledge of the
Gospel which they strive to spread!  If a man look on it
merely as a theory, he is very likely to be ashamed of it; but if
he know the joy of an abiding and soul-saving union with his
Lord, then may we hope to see him take his stand, as an earnest
and unflinching witness for Christ.  It is the deep sense of
Divine love that must move all hearts to labour for His
kingdom.  So may God grant us all grace to labour till the
day when all toil shall cease in the joyful presence of our
reigning Lord!  How shall we then feel, if you and I are
permitted to meet on that day, on the right hand of the
throne!  What triumphant praises will then burst forth from
the whole company of God’s elect! what joy will thrill
through every heart, to whom the Lord shall in that day be
pleased to say, “Well done, good and faithful servant;
enter thou into the joy of thy Lord!”  Let us labour
now with that bright end in view; remembering that we are nothing
and thanking God for the knowledge of our nothingness; but
remembering, likewise, that Christ Jesus is our all, our life,
our peace, our joy, our hope; and that, therefore, it is our
delightful privilege, although we be nothing, to cast that
nothing before His throne, and consecrate all with entire
simplicity to His service.<div class=gapspace> </div><div class=gapmediumline> </div><p style=text-align:center><span class=GutSmall>J. M.

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.</div><div>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</div><div>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Literary Archive Foundation</div><div>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</div><div>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href=https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/>www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</div><div>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</div><div>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</div><div>Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</div><div class=secthead>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</div><div>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</div><div>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</div><div>Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href=https://www.gutenberg.org>www.gutenberg.org</a>.</div><div>This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</div><button id=scroller onclick=topFunction()>&#8593;</button>
